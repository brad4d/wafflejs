  Phase 1: Just generate permuatations.
  1. Just copy word to output.
  1. Generate all possible combinations
     - ignoring duplicates (pretend all letters are different).
  2. Store results in a set to eliminate duplicates.
  3. Sort and display results.
  Phase 2:

-->
<!--
  Possible improvements:
  - <enter> in original word field submits.
  - submit button disabled when original word is empty
  - Make output area a table.
-->
<!--
  Important ingredients:
    1. At least 3 queries needed to complete task.
    2. Some queries constructed with results from previous queries.
    3. Loop required.
    4. Entertaining to watch in action.
    5. Potential audience participation (twitter?)
    6. Possibly realistic use-case.
    7. Promise.race() usage?
    8. Has a usable offline mode.
    9. Demonstrate that page remains usable.
    10. not a case where the server should really do this work.
        - mashup - no server has all the data (but couldn't ours pull it together?)
        - node.js - we are the server
        - chrome app or extension

  Ideas:
  - Mashup data from multiple sources.
  - Paging through data.
  - Name combiner?
  - Mad libs
  - Match Trump tweet to Fox news
  - battleship game?
  - whack a mole?
  - Enter a word & fetch anagrams and their definitions.
    - server just looks up a single word at a time
